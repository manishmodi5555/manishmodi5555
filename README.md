I’m in my 3rd year, steadily building a foundation in computer science and diving deeper into the world of technology and development.

🚀 **Professional Experience**  
I'm currently Training at **InfoLabz Private Limited** 🏢, where I’m getting hands-on experience with modern web technologies, building real-world applications, and honing my skills in both frontend and backend development. This experience is giving me invaluable insights into the industry, working with a team, and tackling challenging projects.

💡 **Skills & Technologies**  
My journey as a developer started with a strong curiosity about how things work under the hood. Here’s a quick overview of my current skill set:

- **Programming Languages:**

  - **JavaScript** 💻 - Essential for web development, building interactive and dynamic web applications.

- **Frontend Development:**  
  - **ReactJS** ⚛️ - I love building user interfaces with React’s component-based architecture, making UI/UX smoother and more intuitive.

- **Backend Development:**  
  - **Node.js** 🖥️ and **Express** 🚀 - My preferred tools for building robust backend services and REST APIs.

- **Database Management:**  
  - **MongoDB** 🍃 - Using NoSQL to store and retrieve data efficiently, especially in scalable applications.

🌱 **Continuous Learning**  
I’m always on the lookout for the latest trends in web development and strive to keep my knowledge up to date. From exploring new frameworks and libraries to working on open-source projects, I’m always challenging myself to grow as a developer.

🎯 **Future Goals**  
My ambition is to become a well-rounded software engineer who can work on both frontend and backend seamlessly, ultimately building high-quality products that make a positive impact. I'm particularly interested in learning more about cloud computing, DevOps, and data structures and algorithms.

✨ **Fun Facts & Hobbies**  
Outside of coding, I love diving into tech articles, watching tutorials, and tinkering with new technologies. When I’m not in front of my computer, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, and exploring the world of AI and machine learning.
